            <span class="card-title">Classical Ballet</span>
            <p>Ballet is a fine art and requires a strong basic foundation. The Cecchetti method is a graded system of classical ballet which takes the student from the first lesson to solo status. Examinations are offered to test the student's proficiency within each of the grades. The exams provide them with an opportunity to perfect their technique and the satisfaction of knowing they have accomplished this goal. It is "Les Cher's" intent to provide this training through a progression of well-balanced technique classes. Click on a class link to learn more.</p>
            <p>Exam candidates are required to take a minimum of two classes per week and will be presented for an exam at the directors' discretion. Private lessons may be available to supplement classes for the purpose of extra instruction.</p>
